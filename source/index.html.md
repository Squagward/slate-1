# Introduction

ct.js is a framework for Minecraft Forge that allows for mods to be scripted, in
languages such as JavaScript. Scripts are able to be hot reloaded, which means
you can make changes to your mod without restarting!

<aside class="warning">
  Currently, only JavaScript is supported.
</aside>

JavaScript scripts are executed with our custom fork of Mozilla's 
[Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino)
library. Our custom fork supports many ES6 and ESNEXT features. For the (almost)
full feature list,check our 
[compatibility table](https://chattriggers.github.io/rhino/);

# Setup

To setup ct.js, all you have to do is put the ct.js jar into your `mods` folder,
and launch Minecraft. By default, ct.js modules are stored in 
`.minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules/`, but this can be changed in the 
configuration. To access the ct.js settings, type `/ct settings` in game. The 
rest of this tutorial will refer to this directory as the "modules directory",
and will assume it is in the default location.
 
# Creating a module

To create a module, create a folder in your modules folder. The folder can have
whatever name you want, but typically it is just the name of the module. Our
module will be called ExampleModule. Our folder structure now looks like 
`.minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules/ExampleModule`.

## The metadata file

> An example `metadata.json` file

```json
{
  "name": "ExampleModule",
  "creator": "YourNameHere",
  "description": "Our first module!"
}
```


If we intend to share our module through the 
[ct.js website](https://chattriggers.com), we'll need a `metadata.json` file.
This file contains important information about our module. You can see an
example of this file to the right. The metadata file contains a number of 
important fields, documented here:

- `name`: The name of the module
- `creator`: The name of the module creator
- `version`: The version of the module. This should conform to 
  [SEMVER](https://semver.org/)
- `entry`: This is the name of a file that should actually be ran. This key is
  necessary if, for example, your module registers triggers or commands. An 
  example of when you wouldn't want to use this field is if your module is a 
  library, meaning that it is only used by other modules
- `requires`: An array of names of other modules that your module depends on.
  These modules are guaranteed to be loaded before your module, allowing you to 
  use them directly.
- `asmEntry` and `asmExposedFunctions`: These will be discussed later in the ASM
  section

## Scripting

We now need to create our script files. Typically, the root file of your module
is named `index.js`. This is a general web development practice. You can name
your files whatever your want, however one benefit of having an `index.js` file
is that if someone tries to import from your module folder directly, instead of
a specific file in your module, it will be imported from the `index.js` file, if
one exists. If no `index.js` file exists, other people will have to import
directly from the files themselves.

# The Basics

## Registering a Trigger

>We register a WorldLoad trigger like so:

```javascript
register("worldLoad", exampleWorldLoad);
```

>The argument passed into the register function is the function you want to trigger:

```javascript
function exampleWorldLoad() {
  
}

register("worldLoad", exampleWorldLoad);
```

>You can also register an anonymous function for simplicity:

```javascript
register("worldLoad", () => {

});
```

The base of ct.js imports are called "triggers". These are events that get fired
when a certain action happens in game, like a sound being played or a chat 
message being sent. Let's start with one of the simplest triggers: WorldLoad. In
order to register a trigger, we use the provided `register` function. It takes
the trigger name as the first argument (case-insensitive), and the function to
run as the second argument. You can see a complete list of these triggers on our 
[javadocs, under `IRegister`](https://www.chattriggers.com/javadocs/com/chattriggers/ctjs/engine/IRegister.html).

<aside class="notice">
  To convert an IRegister name to a trigger name, just remove the "register" from the beginning of the method name.
</aside>

Now any code inside of our `exampleWorldLoad` trigger will be ran whenever a world is loaded. From here, you 
can do many things, such as interacting with Minecraft methods or getting information from arguments that 
certain triggers may pass in.

<aside class="notice">
  You can register as many triggers as you want, and you can even use the same function in multiple different triggers.
</aside>

## Trigger arguments

> Preparing a trigger to intercept messages

```js
register('messageSent', (message, event) => {
  // TODO
});
```

> Display "Pong!" in response to a message sent containing "ping"

```js
register('messageSent', (message, event) => {
  if (message.toLowerCase().contains('ping')) {
    ChatLib.chat('Pong!');
  }
});
```

In addition to letting you know when an event has occurred by calling your function, many trigger pass through additional information about their respective event. Let's take a look at a different trigger: MessageSent. This trigger is fired whenever a player sends a message.

Let's make a trigger that, whenever the player sent a message with the word "ping", we display the message "Pong!". In order to do this, we need to accept the arguments passed in by the MessageSent trigger. You can see all the arguments that a trigger passes through in the javadocs linked above. The MessageSent trigger passes in the message event and the actual message.

Many triggers are _cancellable_, meaning that they actually fire _before_ whatever the event in question happens. In our case, our MessageSent trigger will fire before the chat message is actually sent. Cancelling the event is as easy as calling `cancel(event)`, however we won't do that here.

We are interested in the message parameter. We simply check if it contains the word we are interested in, and if so, we use the `ChatLib` utility to send a message only visible to the player. You can read more about the `ChatLib` utility [here](TODO)

## Module Organization

When making a module, it is important to know how ct.js loads your files so you can organize them efficiently. When your module is loaded, the root folder and any subfolders are scanned for files of the correct type (for example, `.js` files) and are loaded as one big file. 

Those with previous programming experience with Javascript may be familiar with NodeJS's `require` system, where in order to get access to code in another file, you have to call a function and provide the file path. In ct.js, all of your module files are compiled into one big file and loaded at once. This means that if you define a global variable in one file, you can use it immediately in any other file in your module.

In fact, all modules share the same global namespace. This means that if you define a global variable in your module, you can access it from any other module*. Because the global namespace is shared with all modules, it is highly recommended **NOT** to use common variable names, such as `x` or `player`, as global variable names. 

One way to handle global variables is to prefix any of your global variables with your module name, decreasing the chance of someone else using the same variable name. Another way is to define a single global object to store all of your variables and functions.

<aside class="warning">*In order to use variables and function defined in other modules, you must list those module names in your module's <code>required</code> array in the <code>metadata.json</code> file</aside>
