# Introduction

ct.js is a framework for Minecraft Forge that allows for mods to be scripted, in languages such as JavaScript.
Scripts are able to be hot reloaded, which means you can make changes to your mod without restarting!

<aside class="warning">Currently, only JavaScript is supported.</aside>

JavaScript scripts are executed with Java's [Nashorn](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/) library,
which means you can use all extensions it includes, found [here](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Nashorn/Nashorn+extensions).

<aside class="success">JavaScript <em>can</em> access Minecraft classes.</aside>

# Setup

To setup a ct.js coding environment, all you have to do is put the ct.js jar into your `.minecraft/mods` folder, and launch 
Minecraft. In your mods folder, you will get a folder structure automatically created. The structure should be<br/>
 `.minecraft/mods/ChatTriggers/Imports` and `.minecraft/mods/ChatTriggers/libs`.
 
# Creating an Import

To create an import, create a folder in your `.minecraft/mods/ChatTriggers/Imports` folder, and have it's name be the name
of your import. Our import will be called Example. Our folder structure now looks like<br/> `.minecraft/mods/ChatTriggers/Imports/Example/`.

We now need to create our scripts, so create a file in the folder named whatever you would like, the name is only for your
own management of the import. We'll call our main file `main`.

<aside class="notice">
Make the extension of the file be the normal extension for your specified language, i.e. main.js for JavaScript.

# The Basics

##Registering a Trigger

>We register a WorldLoad trigger like so:

```javascript
TriggerRegister.registerWorldLoad("exampleImportWorldLoad");
```

The base of ct.js imports are "Triggers". These are events that get fired when a certain action happens in game,
like a sound is played, or chat message is received. A full list of these is at the <a href="#triggers">bottom of the page</a>.
 
So, we want to start of by listening to one of these, let's start with one of the simplest, WorldLoad.

What we're doing here is calling a method in the "TriggerRegister" class that registers "exampleImportWorldLoad" as a trigger
to be activated when the world is loaded. However, there is no function with that name yet!

##Receiving the Event

```javascript
TriggerRegister.registerWorldLoad("exampleImportWorldLoad");

function exampleImportWorldLoad() {
  
}
```

Everything inside of this function is ran when the world loads. From here we can call other methods, interact with Minecraft,
and many other things. 

<aside class="notice">Multiple triggers can refer to one function.</aside>

##Responding to an Event

```javascript
TriggerRegister.registerWorldLoad("exampleImportWorldLoad");

function exampleImportWorldLoad() {
  ChatLib.chat("&6Gold Text says that the world has just loaded!");
}
```


One of the things we can do inside of function is send a message to the player.

The best way to interact with Minecraft's chat is via the `ChatLib` class. It is accessed very simply through the
variable ChatLib. A list of the methods it provides can be found in the documentation [here](http://ct.kerbybit.com/ct.js/com/chattriggers/ctjs/libs/ChatLib.html).
